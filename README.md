# restaurant-randomizer
    An app to help you pick a restaurant when you are hungry! 


## Getting started

- Clone from https://github.com/Kanpii/restaurant-randomizer.git
- Grab a Yelp API key from yelp.com
- Toss the API key into a .env file as "YELP_API_KEY" 
- Boot up Docker
- cd into restaurant-randomizer directory
- Run docker-compose build
- Run docker-compose up
- Go to browser, http://localhost:3000/

    - Type in a location (ex: LA or Los Angeles or San Francisco)
    - Type in a food type (ex: hamburgers, ice cream, etc.)
    - Hit "Randomize!" and see what you get!



## Description

    This project was built with Django on the backend, with React for the frontend. It uses the Yelp API to produce the search results. 

## Upcoming Plans
- Need to rewrite the React portion from class components to function components.
- Need to add some HTML / CSS so it looks nice
